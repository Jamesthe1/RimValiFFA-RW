		<baseDesc>Belonging in a pack of scouts tasked with keeping an important facility secure in the mountain region, [PAWN_nameDef] spent long nights at temporary camps watching for potential threats.

		<baseDesc>Trained and supplied by the Illuminate government, [PAWN_nameDef]'s extraordinary augments and skills combined made [PAWN_objective] a deadly sniper. [PAWN_possessive] targets mostly included notorious pirates and dissenters when they dared to make a presence in Illuminate grounds, but sometimes, [PAWN_possessive] skill were also used to get rid of someone who knows things they shouldn't.\n The nature of the job made [PAWN_nameDef] a target to whoever knew of [PAWN_objective]. [PAWN_pronoun] stayed away from [PAWN_possessive] pack to avoid them becoming a target for retaliation, relying on infrequent encrypted holo-calls to keep in touch.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>As a veteran in a pirate gang, [PAWN_nameDef] was present in some of the most infamous raids against high value cargo ships. A heavily armored captain in the front line, [PAWN_pronoun] developed the skills to remain calm and call the shots even in a seemingly chaotic and explosive brawl.\n After just barely evading capture by a devastating Illuminate raid, [PAWN_nameDef] managed to be taken under the wing by a pack of artisans with a fake identity and a sympathetic story about losing everything to pirates. [PAWN_pronoun] worked overnight to distract [PAWN_possessive] mind when [PAWN_possessive] past deeds kept [PAWN_objective] from sleeping.</baseDesc>
