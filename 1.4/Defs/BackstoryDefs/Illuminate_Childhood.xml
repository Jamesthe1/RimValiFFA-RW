		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] liked making and modding slingshots as a kit. [PAWN_pronoun] often rummaged through discarded building materials and electronics to look for any scraps that can make [PAWN_possessive] inventions hit better or harder, and sometimes got into trouble when the same inventions were responsible for some stones through expensive windows.</baseDesc>

		<title>Young Hunter</title>
		<titleShort>Survivor</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s pack belonged to a fringe tribe of survivalists who refused to use many technologies and survived in the wild in small, hand-built shelters. [PAWN_pronoun] showed an aptitude for shooting early on, and was taught to handle a rifle at a very young age to hunt for food or defend [PAWN_possessive] pack from dangers. Discontent with living in the wild, the pack began collecting a stash of valuables, and eventually used it (and their young, adorable faces) to bribe a trade ship and get to a more civilized life.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>The earliest memory that [PAWN_nameDef] had was being carried out of the remain of a burning spaceship by rescuers after a deadly low orbit crash that only [PAWN_pronoun] survived. The physical injury healed quickly thanks to the advanced treatments, but [PAWN_pronoun] never completely recovered from the mental shock. [PAWN_nameDef] used food, and later, experimentations with cooking as a coping mechanism, and shared the results with [PAWN_possessive] foster pack.</baseDesc>

The only thing about [PAWN_objective] that was unusual is [PAWN_possessive] uncanny awareness of surroundings and the ability to quickly strike vitals in unarmed combat. After fruitlessly trying to find out about [PAWN_possessive] past that even [PAWN_possessive] own pack kept from [PAWN_objective], [PAWN_nameDef] left a letter one night and left. Maybe [PAWN_possessive] real pack is out there. Somewhere.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_pronoun] learned quick, but never took the craft seriously.
As [PAWN_pronoun] stayed home one day because of a minor sickness, the pack’s
ship engine critically malfunctioned. [PAWN_nameDef] was left with nothing but
shelves upon shelves of books, and an obligation to pass on the knowledge.</baseDesc>
